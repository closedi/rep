# Welcome to Monty-Hall problem game simulator.

The game was inspired by "Let's make a Deal" TV show. You can manually test some basic strategies and compare results in a fun way.

## Game description

There are 3 doors on a field. One of them contains a Treasure Map (which we want to unlock), but another two doors have some useless trash boxes behind. Map's location is changing randomly for each round.
